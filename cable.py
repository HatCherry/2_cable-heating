def cable(size):
    """
    Calculate the derived geometrical parameters of a cylinder given its cross-sectional area.

    This function returns the area, radius, diameter, and characteristic length of a cylinder
    based on its cross-sectional area in mm^2. The function also applies a characteristic length
    coefficient to adjust the theoretical value.
    
    Parameters:
    - size (float): The cross-sectional area of the cylinder in mm^2.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing the following elements in the given order:
        1. Area in m^2
        2. Radius in meters
        3. Diameter in meters
        4. Adjusted characteristic length in meters
    
    Example:
    >>> cable(10)
    (9.999999999999999e-06, 0.001784124116152771, 0.003568248232305542, 0.0028545985858444336)
